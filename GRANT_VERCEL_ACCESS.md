# Grant Vercel Access to Your GitHub Repository

## The Issue
Vercel can't see your new repository "mcp-eda-hub-nextjs" because it doesn't have permission.

## Solution: Grant Access to Vercel

### Option 1: Through GitHub (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/installations
2. Find "Vercel" in the list
3. Click "Configure"
4. Under "Repository access":
   - Either select "All repositories" 
   - OR click "Select repositories" and add "mcp-eda-hub-nextjs"
5. Click "Save"

### Option 2: Through Vercel
1. In the Vercel Git connection dialog where you see "No Results Found"
2. Look for a link that says "Manage GitHub App Permissions" or "Configure GitHub App"
3. Click it - it will take you to GitHub
4. Add "mcp-eda-hub-nextjs" to the list of accessible repositories
5. Save and return to Vercel
